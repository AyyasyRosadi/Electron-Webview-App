Hi There...

This code is intended to create a desktop application that is directed directly to a website url on the internet.

Have a favorite website that you want to access easily with just one click?

simple way:

1. Installing Package
- using NPM: "run npm i"
- using Yarn: "yarn install"
2. Create Env file and insert your url name, the example like on .example.env file
3. Run it
- using NPM : "npm run start"
- using Yarn : "yarn start"

if work then continue to next step!

4. Run this command: " electron-packager ./ your-app-name --platformm=win32 --arch=x64 --icon=your-icon-path
5. Open bundle and run the exe file

Note:
-> you can modify file package.json using your app name in
- name
- productName
